BACKGROUND: INCOME CLASSIFIER
Census data is one of the largest sources of a variety of statistical information related to
population. It typically includes information related to Age, Gender, Household composition,
Employment Details, Accommodation Details, and so on. Till recent years, collecting census
data has been a manual process involving field visits and registrations. With advances in
technology, the methods of collecting this data have improved to a great extent. And so is the
population! With a population of more than 7 billion, one can imagine the volume of the census
data associated with it. This data is collected from a variety of sources such as manual entries,
online surveys, data from social media and search engines and is in various formats. Traditional
database systems are inefficient at handling such data. This is where Big Data Technologies
come into picture.

Big Data Analytics refers to a set of tools and methods used to obtain knowledge from
information. Application of Big Data Analytics on census data can facilitate better decision
making in various Government and Industrial sectors such as Healthcare, Education, Finance,
Retail, and Housing. One such application is an Income Classifier. In this project, let us take a
sample of world census data and build an Income Classifier using various Big Data Techniques
described in subsequent sections.

This Project is divided into three parts to cover the below learning objectives.
1. HDFS and Hive for Data Storage and Management
2. Data Ingestion using Sqoop
3. Machine Learning using PySpark
